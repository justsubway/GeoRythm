when the API is unreachable.

## Pull Request

There are 2 main work flows when dealing with pull requests:

* Pull Request from a [forked repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)
* Pull Request from a branch within a repository

Here we are going to focus on 2. Creating a Topical Branch:


1. First, we will need to create a branch from the latest commit on master. Make sure your repository is up to date first using

   ```bash
    git pull origin main
   ```

   *Note:* `git pull` does a `git fetch` followed by a `git merge` to update the local repo with the remote repo. For a more detailed explanation, see [this stackoverflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/292357/whats-the-difference-between-git-pull-and-git-fetch).

2. To create a branch, use `git checkout -b <new-branch-name> [<base-branch-name>]`, where `base-branch-name` is optional and defaults to `main`. 
   
   Use a standard convention for branch names. For example, `<your-name>-dev`. It will be easier to track your pull requests if you use this convention.
   
   I'm going to create a new branch called `jsm-dev` from the `main` branch and push it to github.

   ```bash
    git checkout -b jsm-dev main
    git push origin jsm-dev
   ```

3. To create a pull request, you must have changes committed to your new branch.

4. Go to [Pull Requests](https://github.com/JavaScript-Mastery-PRO/project1_team4_repository/pulls) and click on the `New Pull Request` button.

5. Select the `main` branch as the `base` branch and the `jsm-dev` branch as the `compare` branch.

6. Follow the template and fill in the proper information for the pull request.

7. Click on the `Submit` button.

8. You have successfully created a pull request. Now wait for mentor approval. Once approved, you can merge the pull request.
